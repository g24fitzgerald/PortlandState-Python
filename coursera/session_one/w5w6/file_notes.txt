###Reading Files

1. The readline approach (to process only part of a file)
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = ''

line = flanders_file.readline()
while line != "":
    flanders_poem = flanders_poem + line
    line = flanders_file.readline()

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()



2. The for line in file approach (When you want to process every line in the file one at a time)
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = ''

for line in flanders_file:
    flanders_poem = flanders_poem + line

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()



3. The read approach (When you want to read the whole file at once and use it as a single string)
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = flanders_file.read()

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()



4. The readlines approach (When you want to examine each line of the file by index)
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = ''

flanders_list = flanders_file.readlines()
for line in flanders_list:
    flanders_poem = flanders_poem + line

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()


#### Write Files
Writing To A File Within A Python Program
In order to write to a file, we use file.write(str). This method writes a string to a file. Method write works like Python's print function, except that it does not add a newline character.

File dialogs
Module tkinter has a submodule called filedialog. We import it like this:

>>>import tkinter.filedialog
Function askopenfilename asks the user to select a file to open:

>>>tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()
This function returns the full path to the file, so we can use that when we call function open to open that file.

>>>from_filename = tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename()
Function asksaveasfilename asks the user to select a file to save to, and provides a warning if the file already exists.

>>>to_filename = tkinter.filedialog.asksaveasfilename()

Example
Below is a program that copies a file, but puts "Copy" as the first line of the copied file.

In order to prompt a user for a file.

Now we can open the file we want to read from and get the contents:

from_file = open(from_filename, 'r')
contents = from_file.read()
from_file.close()
And we can open the file we want to write to and write the contents:

to_file = open(to_filename, 'w')
to_file.write('Copy\n')  # We have to add the newline ourselves.
to_file.write(contents)  # Now write the contents of the file.
to_file.close()





########Notes on Developing a a Program -showing grade distribution from a file
Top Down Design-break down steps, decide how to store data 
1. Read Grades
2. Count number of grades per range
3. write the histogram to file
